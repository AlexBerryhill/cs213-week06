## Instructions
### 1
The file group_week06.html has already been created for you and contains 4 <section> elements. You will write CSS in a file called group_week06.css to make each of the four sections responsive using FlexBox and/or Grid. In the context of the assignment, responsive means the sections will have a certain appearance at three screen sizes:
Small: less than 600px wide.
Medium: 600px or greater wide.
Large: 1200px or greater wide.

### 5
The download zip file contains three .png files: small_500px.png, medium_1000px.png, and large_1300px.png. These three screenshots show what the assignment might look like if your browser window is 500, 1000, or 1300 pixels wide. Due to the responsive nature of FlexBox and CSS Grid the web page will look different as things grow and shrink at other pixel sizes. Depending on what browser you are using, it might look a bit different that the screenshots even at 500, 1000, or 1300 pixels wide. Nevertheless this will give you an idea of what the finished assignment should look like.
